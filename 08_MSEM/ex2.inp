TITLE:
this is an example of a two-level 
	  regression analysis for a continuous 
	  dependent variable with a random intercept and a latent covariate
DATA:
FILE = "ex2.dat";
 
VARIABLE:
NAMES = ID idys Ideation NA_F; 
 MISSING=.;
 BETWEEN = NA_F;
	  CLUSTER = ID;
DEFINE:
CENTER idys (GRANDMEAN);
ANALYSIS:
TYPE = TWOLEVEL;
    ESTIMATOR=MLR;
MODEL:

    %WITHIN%
	    Ideation ON idys (gamma10);
	    idys;
	  %BETWEEN%
	    Ideation ON NA_F 
	         idys (gamma01);
OUTPUT:
STDYX RESIDUAL;
