TITLE:
this is an example of a two-level 
	regression analysis for a continuous 
	dependent variable with a random slope and a latent covariate
DATA:
FILE = "ex3.dat";
 
VARIABLE:
NAMES = ID idys Ideation NA_F; 
 MISSING=.;
 BETWEEN = NA_F;
	  CLUSTER = ID;
DEFINE:
CENTER idys (GRANDMEAN);
ANALYSIS:
TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;
    ESTIMATOR=BAYES;
MODEL:

    %WITHIN%	
 	    s | Ideation ON idys;
	  %BETWEEN%	
	    Ideation s ON NA_F idys;
	    Ideation WITH s;
OUTPUT:
STDYX RESIDUAL;
