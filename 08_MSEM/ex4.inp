TITLE:
this is the same model as in the previous example but adds time (FUY) as a within-person covariate
DATA:
FILE = "ex4.dat";
 
VARIABLE:
NAMES = ID FUY idys Ideation NA_F; 
 MISSING=.;
 BETWEEN = NA_F;
    WITHIN = FUY;
	  CLUSTER = ID;
DEFINE:
CENTER idys (GRANDMEAN);
ANALYSIS:
TYPE = TWOLEVEL RANDOM;
    ESTIMATOR=BAYES;
MODEL:

    %WITHIN%	
 	    s | Ideation ON idys;
 	    Ideation on FUY;
	  %BETWEEN%	
	    Ideation s ON NA_F idys;
	    Ideation WITH s;
OUTPUT:
STDYX RESIDUAL;
