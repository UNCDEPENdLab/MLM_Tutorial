TITLE:
this is an example of a two-level 
	  regression analysis for a continuous 
	  dependent variable with a random intercept and an observed covariate
DATA:
FILE = "ex1.dat";
 
VARIABLE:
NAMES = ID idys_pm idys_pc Ideation NA_F; 
 MISSING=.;
 WITHIN = idys_pc;
	  BETWEEN = NA_F idys_pm;
	  CLUSTER = ID;
DEFINE:
CENTER idys_pc (GRANDMEAN);
ANALYSIS:
TYPE = TWOLEVEL;
    ESTIMATOR=MLR;
MODEL:
%WITHIN%	
	  Ideation ON idys_pc;
	  %BETWEEN%
	  Ideation ON NA_F idys_pm;
OUTPUT:
STDYX RESIDUAL;
